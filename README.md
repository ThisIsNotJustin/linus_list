### Linked List Implementation in C

This repository contains a high-quality, extendable linked list implementation in C, inspired by Linus Torvalds' philosophy 
on "good taste" in code design. This is the hallmark of the Linux Kernel's engineering principles.


### Acknowledgments
This project is a tribute to Linus Torvalds and the Linux Kernel community, whose dedication to efficient and elegant code continues to inspire developers worldwide.
